                        <strong>Private Swim Lessons</strong> 
                        <br>
                        Our <a href="#">private swim lessons</a> provide one-on-one instruction for students ages three months through adult. 
                        Private swim lessons are the best option for accelerated learning. Each lesson will allow our instructors 
                        to build on the momentum and skills taught in the previous lesson with minimal downtime. From the basics of 
                        putting your face into the water to refining your stroke technique, private lessons will offer the highest 
                        rate of progress.

                        <strong>Semi-Private Swim Lessons</strong>
                        <br>
                        At Splashes, our <a href="#">semi-private swim lessons</a> offer students ages 2.5 to 13 the opportunity to interact with 
                        another student of a similar age and ability while still receiving personal attention. Whether you would like 
                        us to pair your child with another student of similar age and ability or would like to take lessons with a 
                        friend or sibling, our semi-private lessons are a cost effective option. Students also have the opportunity 
                        to observe one another in the lesson.
